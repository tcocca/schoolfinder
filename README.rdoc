= schoolfinder

A gem to interact with the education.com free schoolfinder api.

Register for a Schoolfinder API Key Here:
http://www.education.com/schoolfinder/tools/webservice/

Schoolfinder API Documentation:
http://www.education.com/schoolfinder/tools/webservice/documentation/


== Installation

  gem install schoolfinder

In a rails app:

  config.gem 'schoolfinder'


== Usage

Create a new instance of the Schoolfinder Client

  @schoolfinder = Schoolfinder::Client.new('your_api_key')

You can also pass an optional http timeout setting that httparty will pass to net/http

  @schoolfinder = Schoolfinder::Client.new('your_api_key', 5)

This would make the response trigger a Timeout::Error on the request. 
The client then rescues that request and passes a fake response that will trigger a Schoolfinder::Error with the code 0 and message "a timeout occured".
This is because Schoolfinder currently does not have a error code 0 (only 1-7, see here: http://www.education.com/webservice/documentation/?section=schoolsearch)
So this would raise a:

  #<Schoolfinder::Error: Schoolfinder Error: a timeout occured (code: 0)>

The following methods are available to the Schoolfinder::Client class, each method corresponds to an api call
Each method returns a Schoolfinder::Response which responds to a call to :body

:body is an instance of Hashie::Rash.  Hashie::Rash inherits from Hashie::Mash (see the following:  http://github.com/intridea/hashie ) with the only difference being that in a Hashie::Rash all keys (method names) of the original hash are "rubyified", converted from camelCase to underscore.  So, "methodName"  would be "method_name".  This in turn looks something like the following example:

  @response = @schoolfinder.school_search(:zip => 02215)
  @response.body.first.schoolname # => 'Fenway Park Academy'


=== Schoolfinder::Client methods

Notes on passing params to each method:  All parameter keys should be passed in exactly as stated in the schoolfinder api documentation linked above.

The following default parameters are automatically passed through so you don't need to worry about them:

  sn = sf, key = (your API key), f = (method_name), v = 3
